# 🎫 TicketZero - AI Triage Agent

**Turn vague client emails into ready-to-code engineering tickets in seconds.**

TicketZero is a Micro-SaaS tool designed for freelance developers and agencies. It uses Multimodal AI (Google Gemini 2.5 Flash) to analyze "angry" non-technical bug reports—including screenshots—and instantly converts them into structured Jira/GitHub tickets.

## 🧐 The Problem
Clients often send bug reports like this:
> *"The website is broken! I clicked the button and it froze. Fix it now!"*

Developers waste hours going back and forth to get the **Browser**, **Steps to Reproduce**, and **Actual Error**.

## 💡 The Solution
TicketZero acts as the "Smart Translator."
1.  **Paste the Email:** The AI reads the emotional text.
2.  **Upload the Screenshot:** The AI analyzes the UI state (Vision capabilities).
3.  **Get the Ticket:** Instantly generates a structured report with:
    * **Severity:** (Critical/High/Medium/Low)
    * **Technical Summary**
    * **Steps to Reproduce**
    * **Suggested Technical Fix**
